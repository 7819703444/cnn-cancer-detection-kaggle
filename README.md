# üß¨ CNN Cancer Detection ‚Äì Kaggle Mini Project

This repository contains my submission for the **Histopathologic Cancer Detection** challenge on Kaggle, completed as part of Week 3 of the Coursera "Introduction to Deep Learning" course (University of Colorado Boulder).

The goal is to classify **small histopathology image patches (96x96 pixels)** as either containing metastatic cancer or not (binary classification).
